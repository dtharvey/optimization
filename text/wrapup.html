<h4>Response Surfaces Used in this Module</h4>
<p>The figures to the right show the four response surfaces used in this
module where the factor levels for <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are
restricted to integer values between 0 and 10.</p>
<p><strong><em>example 1 (upper left)</em></strong>: The equation for
this response surface is a second-order polynomial in <em>A</em> and in
<em>B</em> without an interaction between the two factors.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1.68 + 0.24 \times A + 0.56 \times B -
0.04 \times A^2 - 0.04 \times B^2\]</span></p>
<p>When the <span class="math inline">\(A^2\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(B^2\)</span> terms are both negative and similar
in value, as they are here, the resulting response surface has a
dome-like shape. The response surface’s maximum response is at
(3,7).</p>
<p><strong><em>example 2 (upper right)</em></strong>: The equation for
this response surface is a first-order polynomial in <em>A</em> with an
interaction between <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[4.0 - 0.4 \times A + 0.08 \times A
\times B\]</span></p>
<p>Note that when factor level for <em>A</em> is zero, the response is
held constant at 4 for all values of <em>B</em>; this is because
<em>B</em> only appears in the equation’s final interaction term. The
response surface’s maximum response is at (10,10).</p>
<p><strong><em>example 3 (lower left)</em></strong>: The equation for
this response surface is a second-order polynomial in <em>A</em> and in
<em>B</em> with an interaction between the two factors.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[3.264 + 1.537 \times A + 0.5664 \times B
- 0.1505 \times A^2 - 0.02734 \times B^2 - 0.05785 \times A \times
B\]</span></p>
<p>When the <span class="math inline">\(A^2\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(B^2\)</span> terms are both negative, as is the
case here, but not close in value to each other, the resulting response
surface has a ridge-like shape. Although the response surface’s maximum
response is at (3.91,6.22), the restriction that all values of
<em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are integers means it appears at (4,6).</p>
<p><strong><em>example 4 (lower right)</em></strong>: The equation for
this response surface is a second-order polynomial in <em>A</em> and in
<em>B</em> without an interaction between the two factors.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[4 + 0.8 \times A - 0.7 \times B - 0.09
\times A^2 + 0.08 \times B^2\]</span></p>
<p>When one of second-order terms (<span class="math inline">\(A^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B^2\)</span>) is negative and one is positive, as
is the case here, and when they are similar in magnitude, the resulting
response surface has a saddle-like shape. Although the response
surface’s maximum response is at (4.38,0), the restriction that all
values of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are integers means it appears at
(4,0). Note that there also is a local optimum at (4,10).</p>
<p>You can explore the relationship between the signs and relative
magnitudes of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> and the shape of a second-order
polynomial equation using the module <em>AC 3.0: Introduction to
Response Surfaces</em>.</p>

<h4>Rotating Surface Plots</h4>
<p>There are a variety of functions in <code>R</code> to display data in
three dimensions, such as the <code>persp</code> function used in this
module. Such functions use two angles—theta and phi—to define the
direction in which you view the data. These angles are typically defined
only as the azimuthal angle and the colatitude angle. Unless you know
how to navigate by the stars, you likely are not familiar with the
practical meaning of these terms; thus, we describe them here as the
angle by which we rotate the <em>xy</em>-plane around the
<em>z</em>-axis (the azimuthal angle) and the angle by which we tilt the
<em>z</em>-axis relative to the original <em>xy</em>-plane (the
colatitude angle).</p>
