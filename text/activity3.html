<p>The algorithm for a sequential optimization compares responses in
four directions, and the algorithm for a steepest ascent optimization
compares responses in eight directions. A more efficient algorithm
allows for movement in more directions.</p>
<p>One example of a more efficient algorithm measures the response for
three sets of factor levels; these points form the vertices of a
triangle and are called a simplex. The figure (included with the
controls on the upper right) shows the initial simplex in black with the
vertices ranked as the best (B), the next best (NB), and the worst (W)
response. Vertex W is replaced with a new vertex, R, by reflecting it
through the line segment between B and NB. Boundary conditions ensure
that the optimization moves in the direction of an increasing response
that remains within the allowed range of factor levels. The controls on
the upper right allow you to define the simplex’s initial position
(factor levels A and B for the vertex given by the blue dot), the
simplex’s orientation (the number for one of the six triangles), and the
size of the simplex’s sides.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. A simplex is the simplest object we can
draw in <em>N</em>-dimensional space where <em>N</em> is the number of
factors. The simplest figure we can draw in two-dimensions is a
triangle. What makes a triangular-shaped simplex more efficient than a
sequential or a steepest ascent optimization?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Leave the default conditions in place:
example 1; initial factor levels of (2,2); an initial simplex
orientation of 4; and a step-size of 1. Beginning with the initial
simplex (outlined by the filled circles), identify the vertex that is
rejected and the new vertex that replaces it. Repeat for the remaining
simplexes. How many steps make up the optimization’s pathway?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Explore the utility of a fixed-size
simplex for optimizing each of the four response surfaces. How effective
is the simplex optimization in locating their maximum responses? Does
the initial orientation and position of the simplex affect the
algorithm’s effectiveness or its efficiency? Does the size of the
initial simplex affect the algorithm’s effectiveness or its
efficiency?</p>
