<p>Although a sequential optimization generally is effective, it often
is not efficient because it adjusts only one factor at a time. A more
efficient algorithm adjusts all factors at the same time, moving in the
direction that provides the greatest change (steepest ascent) in the
response.</p>
<p>The controls on the right are identical to those on the previous tab
with the exception that the optimization path is always superimposed on
either a contour plot (in 2D) or a surface plot (in 3D). The direction
of the steepest ascent is evaluated by comparing the response in eight
directions: to the north, to the east, to the south, to the west, to the
northeast, to the southeast, to the southwest, and to the northwest The
four response surfaces are identical to those on the previous tab.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Leave the default conditions in place:
example 1; initial factor levels of (0,0); and a display that shows the
path overlayed on a contour plot. Explain how you can tell that the path
to the maximum response at (3,7) is a steepest ascent optimization and
not a sequential optimization.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Select the second example and adjust the
initial factor levels to (10,0). Set the display to show a contour plot
in 2D. How many steps does it take to reach the optimum response? Set up
the same optimization using the tab for a sequential optimization, and
determine how many steps it takes to reach the optimum response. Explain
why the two algorithms take such different pathways and have such
different efficiencies even though they begin in the same place.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Use this tab and the previous tab to
explore the relative efficiencies of the sequential and steepest ascent
algorithms for all four examples. Are there shapes of response surfaces
and/or locations of initial starting points where their efficiencies are
similar? Are there shapes of response surfaces and/or location of
initial starting points where their efficiencies are different?</p>
