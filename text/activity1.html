<p>In a sequential optimization, we begin with a single set of factor
levels and measure the response as we change the level of one factor
while holding constant the level of the other factor. When the response
no longer improves, we switch, holding the first factor constant and
monitoring the response as we change the second factor’s level. We
continue this pattern until a change in either factor’s level does not
increase the response.</p>
<p>Use the controls on the upper right to explore the sequential
optimization for four two-factor response surfaces. The upper set of
sliders gives the initial levels for factor A and for factor B. The two
sets of radio buttons provide access to four ways to visualize the
optimization’s path, which begins with the large filled circle and
extends in a series of steps shown by line segments and small open
circles. The lower set of sliders rotates and tilts the 3D plots. In all
cases, factor A is optimized first. The step-size for each factor is
limited to values of <span class="math inline">\(0, \pm 1\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Leave the default conditions in place:
example 1; initial factor levels of (A,B) = (0,0); and a display that
shows the path only in 2D. Record the position of the optimum response.
Set the display to path only in 3D and compare the 2D and 3D views to
each other. What additional information is available from the 3D view?
Change the initial factor levels to (10,0), (0,10), (10,10), and (5,5).
Is the algorithm’s optimum response sensitive to the choice of initial
factor levels? You may wish to explore a few additional initial factor
levels. Repeat for the other response surfaces</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Look over your data from the previous
exercise and describe the shape of the four response surfaces based on
the paths taken during the optimization. When you are done, set the
display to path &amp; surface in 2D, which overlays the optimization
pathway on a 2D contour plot of the response surface. Is this display
consistent with your prediction of the response surface’s shape? Set the
display to path &amp; surface in 3D, which overlays the optimization
pathway on a 3D surface plot. Is this display consistent with your
prediction of the response surface’s shape? What do your results suggest
about the effectiveness of a sequential optimization?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Using the first example, set the initial
factor levels to (0,0) and count the number of steps it takes to reach
the optimum response, and the number of times the algorithm switches
between the two factors. Repeat for the other three examples. What do
your results suggest about the efficiency of a sequential
optimization?</p>
