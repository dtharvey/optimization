<p>The efficiency and effectiveness of a fixed-size simplex optimization
is limited by the size of the initial simplex. A small simplex is less
efficient because it requires more experiments to reach the optimum
response, and a large simplex is less effective when the size of the
simplex prevents a vertex from aligning closely with the optimum
response.</p>
<p>In a variable-sized simplex optimization (see figure included with
the controls on the upper right) we allow the size of the simplex to
expand or contract in response to the relative change in the response.
The figure shows the initial simplex in black with the vertices ranked
as the best (B), the next best (NB), and the worst (W) response. Vertex
W is replaced with a new vertex, R, by reflecting it through the line
segment between B and NB. Depending on the response for R relative to B,
NB, and W, the new vertex can be extended to E or contracted to CR or to
CW.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Leave the default conditions in place:
example 1; initial factor levels of (1,1); an initial simplex
orientation of 4; and 1 iteration. Using the slider for iterations, step
through the optimization, identifying at each step the vertex that is
rejected and the new vertex that replaces it. Can you identify the
conditions that lead to expanding, retaining, or contracting the
reflected vertex? How many iterations does it take to reach the optimum
response? How does this compare to a fixed-size simplex
optimization?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Explore the utility of the
variable-sized simplex optimization for optimizing the response surfaces
in all four examples. How effective is the variable-sized simplex
optimization in locating the maximum responses? Does the initial
position and orientation of the simplex affect the algorithmâ€™s
effectiveness or efficiency?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Pick one of the four response surfaces
and complete the optimization using each of the four algorithms. Use the
same initial factor levels of (2,2) in each case, and use a step-size of
1 for the fixed-size simplex optimization to be compatible with the
initial step-size of the other algorithms. Repeat using initial factor
levels of (2,8), (8,2), and (8,8). Compare the algorithms in terms of
the effectiveness and their efficiency.</p>
