The efficiency and effectiveness of a fixed-size simplex optimization is limited by the size of the initial simplex. A small simplex is less efficient because it requires more experiments to reach the optimum response, and a large simplex is less effective when the size of the simplex prevents a vertex from aligning closely with the optimum response. 

In a variable-sized simplex optimization (see figure included with the controls on the upper right) we allow the size of the simplex to expand or contract in response to the relative change in the response. The figure shows the initial simplex in black with the vertices ranked as the best (B), the next best (NB), and the worst (W) response. Vertex W is replaced with a new vertex, R, by reflecting it through the line segment between B and NB. Depending on the response for R relative to B, NB, and W, the new vertex can be extended to E or contracted to CR or to CW. 

**Exercise 1**. Leave the default conditions in place: example 1; initial factor levels of (1,1); an initial simplex orientation of 4; and 1 iteration. Using the slider for iterations, step through the optimization, identifying at each step the vertex that is rejected and the new vertex that replaces it. Can you identify the conditions that lead to expanding, retaining, or contracting the reflected vertex? How many iterations does it take to reach the optimum response? How does this compare to a fixed-size simplex optimization?

**Exercise 2**. Explore the utility of the variable-sized simplex optimization for optimizing the response surfaces in all four examples. How effective is the variable-sized simplex optimization in locating the maximum responses? Does the initial position and orientation of the simplex affect the algorithm's effectiveness or efficiency? 

**Exercise 3**. Pick one of the four response surfaces and complete the optimization using each of the four algorithms. Use the same initial factor levels of (2,2) in each case, and use a step-size of 1 for the fixed-size simplex optimization to be compatible with the initial step-size of the other algorithms. Repeat using initial factor levels of (2,8), (8,2), and (8,8). Compare the algorithms in terms of the effectiveness and their efficiency.
