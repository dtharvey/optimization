<p>In the presence of <span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem}
\ce{H2O2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ce{H2SO4}\)</span>,
a solution of <span class="math inline">\(\ce{VOSO4}\)</span> forms a
reddish brown color. The absorbance of the solution at 450 nm is a
useful method for determining the concentration of vanadium in a sample.
The absorbance also depends on the relative amounts of <span class="math inline">\(\ce{H2O2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ce{H2SO4}\)</span> used: in particular, a large
excess of <span class="math inline">\(\ce{H2O2}\)</span> decreases the
absorbance as it changes from a reddish brown color to a yellowish
color. To develop a standard method for vanadium we must determine the
amount of <span class="math inline">\(\ce{H2O2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ce{H2SO4}\)</span> that will maximize the
absorbance at 450 nm. Using the terminology of chemometrics, we identify
absorbance as the system’s response. Hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid
are factors whose concentrations, or factor levels, determine the
system’s response. A plot that shows how the response changes over a
range of factor levels is called a response surface.</p>

<h4>Finding the Optimum Response</h4>
<p>One way to find the optimum response is to use a searching algorithm.
The figure on the right—which shows a portion of the South Dakota
Badlands, a barren landscape that includes many narrow ridges formed
through erosion—illustrates our challenge. Suppose you wish to reach the
ridge’s highest point. Because the path is not obvious, you might adopt
the following simple rule: look around you and take one step in the
direction that has the greatest change in elevation, and repeat this
instruction until no further movement is possible. The route you follow
is the result of this searching algorithm. Of course there are as many
routes as there are starting points, three examples of which we see in
the figure. Note that some routes do not reach the highest point, which
we call the global optimum. Instead, many routes end at a local optimum
from which further movement is impossible. A searching algorithm is
evaluated by its effectiveness (Did it find the global optimum?) and by
its efficiency (Did it find the global optimum quickly?).</p>
<p>In this module you will consider four searching algorithms:
sequential optimization, steepest ascent optimization, fixed-size
simplex optimization, and variable-sized simplex optimization. We will
limit our treatment to two factors so we can display the searching
algorithm’s progress on a contour plot in two-dimensions or on a surface
plot in three dimensions.</p>
